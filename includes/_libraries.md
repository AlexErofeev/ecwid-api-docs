# API playground

To quickly learn Ecwid API and see it in action even before you start development of your application, you can use Ecwid API playground. The playground is basically a collection of presets for [PostMan](http://www.getpostman.com/). You can load it in PostMan application and try accessing and managing your store data via API. 

Using the playground is easy. All you will need is:

* "PostMan" Chrome extension (it's free) . You can download it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop)
* An Ecwid store which has access to API (the store needs to be on a paid plan)

To get more details and install the playground, please open this page: [api-playground.ecwid.com](https://api-playground.ecwid.com/)

# Legacy Ecwid API

**Legacy Ecwid API** is a part of Ecwid API platform functionality, that was available for any store owner on a paid plan. It allowed developers to access and modify their store through the REST API requests. 

You may have accessed it earlier on this page: `https://my.ecwid.com/cp/CP.html#legacy_api`

Since the current Ecwid API plaftorm fully replaced the Legacy Ecwid API and added new features, the Legacy Ecwid API will be **deprecated and no longer be available after February 1st 2017**.
