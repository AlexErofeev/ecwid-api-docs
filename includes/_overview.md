# Overview
Ecwid REST API is built on oAuth2 and allows you to develop an application interacting with Ecwid stores from outside. With the help of Ecwid API, your application can

* track user orders and inventory and generate custom reports based on that data
* print shipping labels for placed orders in user's store
* integrate user's store with any third party service, e.g. email marketing apps
* add new widgets or customize design of the storefront 
* add advanced order/product management tools into Ecwid control panel
* etc.

The **high-level steps** you will take to use Ecwid API are: 

1. [Registering an application in Ecwid](#register-your-app-in-ecwid)
2. [Implementing the OAuth flow](#authentication)
3. [Managing user's store data in your application](#---rest-api-reference---)
