# API features

### REST API

Ecwid REST API allows your application to manage Ecwid store on behalf of an Ecwid user. Create products, update orders, delete a customer and many many more.

Check out all available methods: [REST API](#rest-api-reference)

### Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to get an instant notification after an event ocurred in an Ecwid store. Send information to accounting right after an order was placed, send a note after a product was updated - it's totally up to you.

More information: [Webhooks](#webhooks)

### Application Storage

Application storage is a key/value storage that can serve as a database for your application and a way to send details to user's storefront. All data is kept on Ecwid servers, so you don't need to worry about keeping the data safe. 

More information: [Application storage](#application-storage)

### Customize Storefront

Ecwid has a beautifully designed storefront that is aimed to direct customers to make a purchase in a store. If you want to customize how it looks or its logic - you can do that too: attach an external Javascript file or adapt a store to make it stylish.

### Native Apps

Will your app has a settings page for a user to update them quickly? Place it right in Ecwid Control Panel! It is a great way to put your app up front to the users and let them use if more often.

### Single Sign-On

Ecwid is a widget, that can be inserted to any website. Many websites have their own login functionality as well as Ecwid. You can use Single Sign-On To allow your customers to sign in to their account in Ecwid automatically right after they sign in to your website. It will save your customers' time and let them concentrate on shopping in your store.

# Applications for Ecwid

In Ecwid there can be two main categories of applications: Native and External apps. 

### Native applications

Native applications work inside of Ecwid Control Panel in a separate tab, just like Shipping Settings or Design. This way of embedding your app into user interface puts your app right before the day-to-day workflow of an Ecwid store owner and it is a great way to design an app for Ecwid. Using Ecwid JS SDK it's very easy to get access token for a store.

More details: [Native apps](#native-applications).

### External applications

External applications work outside of Ecwid Control panel and user would interact and control them on a separate website. This approach is great for applications that provide extensive feature set for store owners and would require implementing oAuth flow to get access token for a specific Ecwid store.
